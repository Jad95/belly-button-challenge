# belly-button-challenge

In this task, your objective is to construct an engaging interactive dashboard aimed at delving into the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetâ€”an extensive collection characterizing the microorganisms inhabiting human navels.

This compilation of data brings to light a select few microbial species (referred to as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) which appeared in over 70% of the participants, while the remainder remained comparably scarce.

Within the interface, you'll encounter these distinct components:

1. A drop-down menu dedicated to test subjects. This menu is designed to dynamically populate options based on the provided sample data.
2. A panel accompanied by three distinct graphs, all dynamically generated in response to the chosen subject:
   - A Demographic Panel that succinctly presents the subject's pertinent information.
   - A Bar Graph providing a visual representation of the ten most prevalent OTUs identified in this specific subject.
   - A Bubble Graph conveying the distribution of OTUs along with their corresponding sample values.
   - A Gauge, thoughtfully incorporated to reveal the frequency of washing habits.
